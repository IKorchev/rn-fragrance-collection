## Perfume Picker App



Mobile App built with React-Native & TailwindCSS using Expo CLI.
Users are able to search for perfumes and build their collection which is stored on firebase.
They can use the random perfume picker and also keep track of how many times they have worn a perfume.
The back end is Vercel Cloud function that scrapes for data from _https://www.parfumo.net/_ with Puppeteer.
